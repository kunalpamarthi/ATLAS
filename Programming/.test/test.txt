Given an integer array data of size arr_size where the minimum size of array is 1. Each
integer appears once or twice. Write a function which will return an array of all the integers
that appear twice. Ignore the integer if it appears three or more number of times.
Example1:
data = [10, 12, 10, 11, 13, 17, 16, 15, 11]
output = [10, 11]
Example 2:
data = [7, 3, 8, 6, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7]
output = [6]
Complexity: Medium
Problem Statement 2:
John (1) and Jack (2), are friends who construct the wall as per the number of bricks given to
them.
They work turn by turn. John works in the increasing order starting from 1 with an increment
of 1. Jack places twice the bricks as John places in previous turn.
Goal is to find who placed the last brick and how many bricks will be placed in the end.
Example 1:
numberOfBricks: 13
John & Jack will construct the wall
John 1
Total Bricks till now: 1
Jack 1*2
Total Bricks till now: 3
John 2
Total Bricks till now: 5
Jack 2*2
Total Bricks till now: 9
John 3
Total Bricks till now: 12
Jack 3*2
Total Bricks till now: 18
Since total bricks to be placed were 13. But lastly sum became 18, hence lastly Jack has to place on 1
more brick. The correct answer in result array is:
result[0] = 2 // as Jack placed the last brick
result[1] = 1 // only 1 brick was to be placed in the end
Example 2:
numberOfBricks: 10
John & Jack will construct the wall
John 1
Total Bricks till now: 1
Jack 1*2
Total Bricks till now: 3
John 2
Total Bricks till now: 5
Jack 2*2
Total Bricks till now: 9
John 3
Total Bricks till now: 12
Since total bricks to be placed were 10. But lastly sum became 12, hence lastly John has to place on 1
more brick. The correct answer in result array is:
result[0] = 1 // as John placed the last brick
result[1] = 1 // only 1 brick was to be placed in the end"
